Props vs state quiz:

1. How would you describe the concept of state? 
A: States are mutable values that belong to components. 

Given A: A way for react to remember saved values from within a component. This is similar to declaring variables from within a component, with a few added bonuses. 

2. When would you want to use props instead of state? 
A: When an attribute does not change at any point in time. 

Given A: Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that component can determine what will get displayed on the screen. 

3: When would you want to use state instead of props?

4: What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
A: Immutable means not changing. Props are immutable, states are not.  

Given A:
